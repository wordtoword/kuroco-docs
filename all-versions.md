description: The notification module enables you to create and send e-mail notifications easily.
---

## Overview

In Kuroco, you can create periodic notifications (such as newsletters) using the Notification module. Each entry or issue is called a "message", which can be managed through the Messages sub-module. 

This tutorial explains the full delivery workflow of a simple e-newsletter issue.

## What you'll learn

After completing this tutorial, you will know how to:
- [Create a period notification](#creating-a-notification)
- [Set and verify the mailing list](#specifying-the-default-recipients)
- [Add a new entry to the periodic notification](#composing-a-new-message)
- [Schedule the delivery for a set date and time](#scheduled-delivery)
- [Verify notification statuses](#verifying-the-delivery-status)

## Before you start

For this tutorial, we will be adding recipients to our mailing list from a custom member filter. You can do so in different ways depending on the version of Kuroco you are using.

### Stable version users
Create a custom member filter called "Premium members" in advance. A detailed guide on how to do this can be found in [Tutorial: Using custom member filters](/docs/tutorials/using-custom-member-filters/).

### Beta/RC users [[::.version_brc]]
Coose one of the following options:   
- Create a custom member filter called "Premium members" in advance. A detailed guide on how to do this can be found in [Tutorial: Using custom member filters](/docs/tutorials/using-custom-member-filters/).
- Create the filter during the notification setup. (See "[New filter (Beta/RC only)](#b-new-filter-betarc-only)" section below.)

## Creating a notification 

In the sidebar menu, select [Campaign] -> [Notification].

For demo purposes, we will create a periodic notification called "Kuroco newsletter".   
Fill in the following information in the editor:

| Field | Sub-field | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Name | | `Kuroco newsletter` |
| Information | | Enter a short description of your notification (optional). |
| Sender | E-mail address | Enter your "From" e-mail here (default = `noreply@kuroco-mail.app`). |
